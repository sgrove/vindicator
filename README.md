Node Crawler
========

*"A fun toy"*

Just a sample crawler to tell you if you have any dead links. Please keep in mind this is just an off-the-cuff project and not meant to represent any sort of good practices.

TODO
------------------

Add credentials for basic auth to be able to crawl behind protected sites as well.
